	<p><h3>Theocracy</h3> <img src=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/iran_power/img/guardian_council_203.jpg" />
		<br />Your state is under a <b>Theocracy</b>. The affairs of state and religion are one and the same. Religious leaders are appointed by the government, and government policy is legitimatized and set by religious leaders. Other religions may be persecuted or discouraged. Depending on the degree of social freedom, there may be morality police and religious laws.
		<br />"Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love of self...the heavenly by the love of God." - St. Augustine
		<br />"Toleration, in fine, never led to civil war; intolerance has covered the earth with carnage. Choose, then, between these rivals - between the mother who would have her son slain and the mother who yields, provided his life be spared. " - Voltaire
	</p>
	<p><h3>State Atheism</h3> <img src="http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/27/2741/R3RND00Z/posters/anti-religious-propaganda-by-german-communists-religion-is-the-opium-of-the-people.jpg" />
		<br /> Your state is under <b>State Atheism</b>. Religion is considered not only false, but also a threat, by the state. Religious leaders are persecuted and their power greatly curtailed under ths law. Religious believers are discouraged. Pogroms against believers, or seizures of church property, may be common.
		<br />"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness." - Karl Marx
		<br />"Secularists want to empty the public square of religion and religious-based morality so they can monopolize the shared space of society with their own views." - Dinesh D'Souza
	</p>
	<p><h3>Free Religion</h3> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhalB4OS6r2KZyH3Sm0uysW6f-ltfh3Gb1vw0dt9U-TvZpvgO3" />
		<br />Your state has <b>Free Religion</b>. There is a separation of church and state. The government does not interfere in the affairs of religions, and religious leaders do not have the official authority to make legislate. Religions may have certain exemptions or protection under the law.
		<br />"Do I propose, then, that every citizen shall be free to follow his own reason, and believe whatever this enlightened or deluded reason shall dictate to him? Certainly, provided he does not disturb the public order." - Voltaire
		<br />"The most abject nonsense will be excused if the utterer can claim the sanction of religion. A country which forbids an established church by law is prey to any denomination. The best that can be said is that this is pluralism of a kind." - Christopher Hitchens
	</p>

	<h2>Civil Rights <a href="#" name="civil">[back to top]</a></h2>
	<p><h3>Libertarian</h3> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRoxXxP3QLPNdayCA8xy_O93WGHh6RSs2MNWPLzf7xTfxFPx-2Dhg" />

		<br />"It is a state of perfect freedom to do as they wish and dispose of themselves and their possessions as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature. They need not ask permission or the consent of any other man." - John Locke
		<br />"There is a fundamental different between freedom from hypocrisy and freedom from the components of humanity that separate man from animals." - Sayyid Qutb
	</p>

		<br />Your state is <b>Conservative</b>. The government actively maintains the social order. The government intervenes in controversial issues, and generally enforces tradition or the majority view. Drugs and alcohol are regulated, if not banned. Patriotism is strongly encouraged. The media must conform to the state. Private gun ownership is limited to favored groups.
		<br />"For we must consider that we shall be as a City upon a Hill, the eyes of all people are upon us." - John Winthrop
		<br />"When legislators try to gain or give someone else absolute power over the lives, liberties and property of the people, they abuse the power which the people had put into their hands." - John Locke
	</p>

	<h2>Politics <a href="#" name="political">[back to top]</a></h2>
	<p><h3>Democratic</h3> <img src="http://www.undispatch.com/un-content/uploads/2010/10/58437422-supporters-guineas.jpg" />
		<br /> Your state is <b>democratic</b>. The ultimate decision making power rests in the people. There is no aristocracy or political class. Laws are voted on in referendums, and almost all positions are elected. There is a myriad of political parties. Suffrage is universal.
		<br />"As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy." - Abraham Lincoln
		<br />"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote. " - Benjamin Franklin
	</p>
	<p><h3>Constitutional</h3> <img src="http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120320&t=2&i=584845723&w=460&fh=&fw=&ll=&pl=&r=2012-03-20T170744Z_1_CBRE82J13P000_RTROPTP_0_BRITAIN" />
		<br /> Your state is <b>constitutional</b>. Power is shared between the government and the people. There may be a king or aristocracy limiting the people's power. The people elect representatives, which then write and vote on laws. There may be only two or three political parties. Suffrage is near-universal.
		<br />"All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter." - Edmund Burke
		<br />"The constitution is social power mobilized and it has no conscience. It can crush the highest and the lowest, removing all dignity and individuality. It has an unstable balance point and no limitations." - Frank Herbert
	</p>
	<p><h3>Autocratic</h3> <img src="http://3gmediaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/north-korea.jpg" />
		<br /> Your state is <b>autocratic</b>. Power is concentrated in an unelected state. There may be a hereditary king, or a military strongman, or a small ruling committee. The people do not vote on laws or representatives, although they may choose local officials. The ruling political party is the only one allowed.
		<br />"The only way to erect such a common power...is to confer all their power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices unto one will." - Thomas Hobbes
		<br />"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever." - George Orwell

	<h2>Economics <a href="#" name="economic">[back to top]</a></h2>
	<p><h3>Decentralization (Decentralized + anything)</h3> <img src="http://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2011/10/no-till-farmers.jpg" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Decentralization</b>. Farmers work for their own sustenance, and sell the remainer in small markets. Industry is mostly small cottage enterprises. Aristans belong to guilds, which own a monopoly on the market and regulate themselves.
		<br />"You are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody." - Jean Jacque Rousseau
		<br />"Man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since. It is combination <i>versus</i> competition, a thousand ceturies long struffle, in which competition has always been worsted." - Jack London
	</p>
	<p><h3>Mercantilism (Capitalist + Mixed Economy)</h3> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR_fWa1XVoCdZXSNwV3LWah8bXSW4juCmFXzlDomB1hcSFKdT2cIA" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Mercantilism</b>. Business is privately-owned, but the government attempts to manage the economy for the benefit of the state. Markets and production quality are regulated in order to keep a favorable trade balance.
		<br />"For the increase of the shipping and the encouragement of the navigation of this nation, which under the good providence and protection of God is so great a means of the welfare and safety of this Commonwealth." - Parliament of England
		<br />"It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers, to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain their expence, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries." - Adam Smith
	</p>
	<p><h3>Socialism (Syndicalist + Mixed Economy)</h3> <img src="http://jlcauvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bread-line1.jpg" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Socialism</b>. The means of production are publicly owned and managed by the state. While private industry may exist, it is taxed heavily. The government provides relief programs for the poor, and actively tries to redistribute wealth.
		<br />"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals." - Albert Einstein
		<br />"The larger the government, the more our livings standards are reduced....The market is smart and the government is dumb, and to these attributes do we owe the whole of our economic well-being." - Lew Rockwell
	</p>
	<p><h3>Corporatism (Capitalist + Planned Economy)</h3> <img src="http://www.aworldtowin.net/images/images380/GeneralStrike1.jpg" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Corporatism</b>. The economy is privately owned but run by the state. The government serves as a mediator between capital and labor; the only unions allowed are government agencies. While production is done for profit, the state uses it for the national interest.
		<br />"For my part I think that capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight, but that in itself it is in many ways extremely objectionable." - John Maynard Keynes
		<br />"Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all." - Adam Smith
	</p>
	<p><h3>Communism (Syndicalist + Planned Economy)</h3> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS4UfhjHYgyvKC611krH3YU5FegbzyWJAoO7EHihxrNkZ1J-oNN" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Communism</b>. There is no private property. The economy is run by a "dictatorship of the proleteriat," managed in favor of the working class. There is no market, and all goods are distributed by the state.
		<br />"Only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." - Karl Marx
		<br />"Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery." - Winston Churchill
	</p>
	<p><h3>Free Enterprise (Capitalist + Free Market)</h3> <img src="http://media-3.web.britannica.com/eb-media/55/96055-004-FCED2028.jpg" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Free Enterprise</b>. All production is privately owned. Businesses are bought, sold, and traded by investors, who pay wages to the worker and keep profit for themselves. The government may regulate the market and have social welfare, but does so very little.
		<br />"Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in his view. But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society." - Adam Smith
		<br />"An industrial civilization, with its precise order and organization of labor, with such primitiveness of feeling and manner, a primitiveness that reminds one of the days when man lived in jungles and caves!" - Sayyid Qutb
	</p>
	<p><h3>Mutualism (Syndicalist + Free Market)</h3> <img src="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Business/ht_blueberry_workes_tennesee_commune_thg_121129_wb.jpg" />
		<br /> Your economic system is <b>Mutualism</b>. Production is publicly owned but part of a free market. Workers collectively own businesses, and share their profits, while competing against other worker collectives. The government may or may not regulate the market. 
		<br />"Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase or command." - Adam Smith
		<br />"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public...but though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary." - Adam Smith

	<h2>Major Religions <a href="#" name="majorreligion">[back to top]</a></h2>
		<h3>Orthodox Christianity &#9766; <a href="#" name="orthodox">[back to top]</a></h3>
		"I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages." <br />
		Orthodox Christianity believes in the ultimate goal of becoming one with God, through the imitation of Christ. In Orthodoxy, Jesus of Nazareth, a 1st century AD religious teacher, is the Messiah (Christ), the Son of God and the savior of humanity. Orthodox Christians practice charity, veneration of icons, and meditation.<br />
		The Orthodox Churches do not have a single head, and are actually communions of smaller independent churches, Bishops being the basic unit of organization. In Eastern Orthodoxy, the Patriarch of Constitinople is first among equals; in Oriental Orthodoxy, the Coptic Pope of Alexandria is first among equals. These two Churches disagree only on the divine nature of Jesus. <br /><br />
		As an Orthodox state, you gain access to the <b>Varangian Guards</b>, an elite unit of the Orthodox Byzantine Empire, made up of Christian converts among the Germanic peoples. Many of them were drawn from the seafaring Vikings. The Varangians were famous for their loyalty and their ferocity in battle. Although they died out in the 15th century, the Varangian spirit lives on in your empire's soldiers.
		
		<h3>Catholic Christianity &#10013; <a href="#" name="catholic">[back to top]</a></h3>
		 "Now the Catholic Faith is this: We worship One God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the substance."<br />
		Catholic Christianity believes in salvation through faith, good works, and the holy sacraments of the church. In Catholicism, Jesus of Nazareth, a 1st century AD religious teacher, is the Messiah (Christ), the Son of God and the savior of humanity. Catholics practice several holy  sacraments, as well as veneration of saints and the Virgin Mary, mother of Christ.<br />
		The Catholic Church is very centralized, with the infallible Pope of Rome in charge of all spiritual and temporal affairs. The Catholic Church professes that it is the direct descendant of Jesus's followers, through the apostle Simon Peter. In addition, there are many religious orders of laymen, the most famous being the Jesuits, Dominicans and the Opus Dei.<br /><br />
		As a Catholic state, you gain access to <b>Crusaders</b>, soldiers from Latin Europe who participated in expeditionary wars for the Church. The Crusades were kicked off by Pope Urban II, and initially succeded in conquering parts of the Levant and Asia Minor. However, the luck of the Crusaders turned and the last Crusade failed in 1291. Despite this, your empire continues to use the famous siege tactics inspired by these Crusaders.
		
		<h3>Protestant Christianity &#10014; <a href="#" name="protestant">[back to top]</a></h3>
		 "I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Christian Church, the Communion of Saints, the Forgiveness of sins, the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting. Amen." <br />
		Protestant Christianity refers to the Christian churches which originated in the Reformation, a reaction against the Catholic Church. Most Protestants believe in salvation is through faith alone, the superiority of scripture and the "priesthood of all believers". Calvinist denominations believe in fate and divine predestination. In Protestantism, Jesus is the Son of God, the sole Savior of humanity, and one of three parts of a single God.<br />
		Protestantism is very decentralized. There are millions of Protestant movements, but most fall into one of seven traditions: Anglican, Baptist, Congregational, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian and Reformed. The most organized of these traditions is the Anglican Communion, headed by the Church of England. The Church of England itself is lead by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and has a hierarchy similar to Catholicism.<br /><br />
		As a Protestant state, you gain access to the <b>Consistory</b>, a secret police and church court in Calvinist countries. Although consistories also existed in the Catholic and Anglican churches, and were not a military order, the Consistory of Geneva under the leadership of John Calvin controlled the civil authorities and ran the city under a strict regime. Today, your empire uses the same system to defend cities from enemies, internal and external.
		 
		<h3>Sunni Islam &#9770; <a href="#" name="sunni">[back to top]</a></h3>
		 "I testify that there is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God."<br />
		Sunni Islam believes in worship of one God alone, and a final Day of Judgement for good and evil. The founding document of Sunni Islam is the Qur'an (recitation) of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), whom Sunni Muslims believe was humanity's final prophet. Sunni Muslims also believe in the authority of the ahadith, the sayings of the prophet, and the consensus of the community. All Muslims practice five pillars: testimony of faith, daily prayer, charity, fasting on Ramadan and pilgrimage to Mecca.<br />
		Originally, the Caliph, chosen by consensus, was the religious and political leader of the Sunni religion. However, civil war and competing dynasties led to a decline in the power of the Caliph. The last Caliphate was abolished in 1924. Although there have been several attempts at reestablishment, the institution has not come back. Sunni Islam has several different legal schools of thought, falling on a spectrum between the Hanafi school of reason and the Zahiri school of tradition.<br /><br />
		As a Sunni state, you gain access to the <b>Mujahedin</b>. Although jihad refers simply to struggle in the name of God, the modern armed jihadist movement began in the 1960s. The most famous "mujahadin" movement was the Afghan insurgency of the 1980s. Foreign fighters came to the country to fight a "holy war" against the Soviet invaders. Today, many militant Sunni groups around the world, including those in your empire, call themselves Mujahedin.
		
		<h3>Shi'i Islam &#9771; <a href="#" name="shii">[back to top]</a></h3>
		"There is no god but God, and Mohammad is the messenger of God, and Ali is the viceregent of God." <br />
		Shi'i Islam, also referred to as Shi'eh, Shi'eh believes in worship of one God alone, and a final Day of Judgement for good and evil. The founding document of Sunni Islam is the Qur'an (recitation) of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh), whom Shi'ieh Muslims believe was humanity's final prophet. Sunni Muslims believe in the final authority of the Imam, the divinely-appointed viceregent of God. All Muslims practice five pillars: testimony of faith, daily prayer, charity, fasting on Ramadan and pilgrimage to Mecca.<br />
		Shi'i Muslims believe in a divinely appointed chain of Imams, starting with Ali son-in-law of Mohammad (pbuh). While there are various Shi'i sects, the most prominent believes that the 12th Imam has gone into hiding. In his absence, mullahs should guide the faithful. There is no formal hierarchy of clerics; however, there is a de facto hierarchy and the honorary title of Ayatollah is considered the highest possible.<br /><br />
		As a Shi'i state, you gain access to the <b>Assassins</b>, a militant order of Nizari Ismailis in Iran and the Levant. Although their name comes from hashish, cannabis use was likely just a derogatory legend. The Assassins famously used public and covert killings to terrorize their enemies, also holding ground through conventional military tactics. The original Assassins were wiped out by the Mongols. However, many other Shi'i militant orders, based on the Shi'i idea of holy martyrdom, exist today, including in your empire.
